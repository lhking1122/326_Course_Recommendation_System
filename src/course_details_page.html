    <h2>COMPSCI 326: Web Programming</h2>

    <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Meng-Chieh Chiu</p>
    <p><strong>Credits:</strong> 4</p>
    <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Fall and Spring</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> COMPSCI 220 (or COMPSCI 230) with a grade of C or better</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The web is arguably today's most important application platform. Web browsers run on practically every device,
      and even many phone applications are in fact web applications under the covers. This course will cover a broad
      range of client-side web technologies, including HTTP itself, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript; it will additionally
      cover key concepts for the server side of web applications, including key value stores and SQL servers. This
      course will also cover key concepts and technologies including AJAX, JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery), and
      web security. This course is hands-on and heavily project-based; students will construct a substantial dynamic
      web application based on the concepts, technologies, and techniques presented during lectures and in readings.
      This course satisfies the IE Requirement and an Elective for both the CS and INFORM Majors. Note: as the name
      web programming denotes, programming is a key component of this class. Previous background in JavaScript is
      strongly recommended.

    <h2>COMPSCI 426: Scalable Web Systems</h2>

    <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Timothy Richards</p>
    <p><strong>Credits:</strong> 3</p>
    <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Fall</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> COMPSCI 320 or COMPSCI 326 with a grade of C or better</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The web has become a large and complex area for application development. Access to an abundance of open source
      languages, libraries, and frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction of a variety of applications with
      several moving parts working in coordination to present to the user the illusion of a single program. In reality,
      web applications are extremely difficult to get right. They involve a large collection of coordinated services,
      multiple databases, complicated user interfaces, security and performance issues, and ever changing 3rd party
      services, spread across physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number
      of concurrent users that access these applications every second. This course will investigate several well known
      web-based applications and the technology and software architecture used to scale these applications. We will also
      study a specific topic related to scalability in software design in the context of web application architecture.
      This course counts as an Elective for the CS and INFORM Majors.
