    "description": "In this course we examine the important problems in operating system design and implementation. The operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer on which they run. The operating system is responsible for allowing resources (e.g., disks, networks, and processors) to be shared, providing common services needed by many different programs (e.g., file service, the ability to start or stop processes, and access to the printer), and protecting individual programs from one another. The course will start with a brief historical perspective of the evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, and then cover the major components of most operating systems. This discussion will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and functionality during the design and implementation of an operating system. Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping), file systems, and operating system support for distributed systems.

Specific topics include linear and non-linear regression, (stochastic) gradient descent, neural networks, backpropagation, classification, Markov decision processes, state-value and action-value functions, temporal difference learning, actor-critic algorithms, the reward prediction error hypothesis for dopamine, connectionism for philosophy of mind, and ethics, safety, and fairness considerations when applying machine learning to real-world problems.

    "description": "This course will introduce core machine learning models and algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. On the theory side, the course will focus on effectively using machine learning methods to solve real-world problems with an emphasis on model selection, regularization, and empirical evaluation. The assignments will involve both mathematical problems and implementation tasks. Knowledge of a high-level programming language is absolutely necessary. Python is most commonly used (along with standard libraries such as numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn), but languages such as Matlab, R, Scala, Julia would also be suitable. While this course has an applied focus, it still requires appropriate mathematical background in probability and statistics, calculus, and linear algebra. The prerequisites for undergrads were previously COMPSCI 383 and MATH 235 (COMPSCI 240 provides sufficient background in probability, and MATH 131/132 provide sufficient background in calculus). Graduate students can check the descriptions for these courses to verify that they have sufficient mathematical background for 589. Strong foundations in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics are essential for successfully completing this course. Graduate students from outside computer science with sufficient background are also welcome to take the course. This course counts as a CS Elective for the CS Major. Undergraduate Prerequisite: MATH 545 and COMPSCI 240 and STATISTC 315/515 all with a grade of C or better.

Such unconditional security cannot be achieved in the classical world. In this course we will introduce the world of quantum cryptographic protocols and describe how the power of quantum mechanics can enable distribution of shared secret keys even with untrusted devices.

From Facebook to Twitter, YouTube to Wikipedia, content created by non-professionals and circulated for commercial and non-commercial motives underpins seven of the top 10 websites in the US, and has become an increasingly important component of the news ecosystem. While social media was initially hailed as a powerful tool for broadening civic participation, many problems have emerged with the rise of the medium, from questions of whether social media usage is bad for our individual mental health, to whether the fabric of our democracy is being damaged by disinformation, fragmentation and hyperpolarization. As legislators look to regulate these platforms and commentators propose shutting them down entirely, this course looks for an alternative: affirmative visions of social media that are good for individuals and society, which we could work towards building. This class examines possible problems with existing modes of social media, discusses ways in which social media could be a benefit to individuals and societies, develops case studies of successful and healthy online communities, and ultimately designs and builds tools to improve existing social media systems or replace them with novel models. Students will write reflectively about weekly readings and discussions and participate in multi-week projects, ultimately building teams to work on final projects.

    "description": "This course is an introduction to the concepts and skills involved with the collection, management, analysis, and presentation of data sets and the data products that result from the work of data scientists. Privacy, algorithmic bias and ethical issues are also discussed. Students will work with data from the financial, epidemiological, educational, and other domains. The course provides examples of real-world data that students work with using various software tools. This course consists of two lecture meetings and one lab meeting per week. Readings will be assigned as preparation for each class meeting. A semester project will be assigned. Students work in pairs to develop their project over the semester. The project provides students with an opportunity to work collaboratively to explore the topics in more depth in a specialized domain. A midterm and final exam will be given. Grades are determined by a combination of scores on lab activities, projects, and exam scores. Software: all software is freely available. Open to INFORM majors. Prerequisite: a grade of C or or above in the following courses: CICS 110 (or CICS 160 or COMPSCI 119 or COMPSCI 121) with a grade of C or above and either: PSYCH 240, OIM 240, STATISTC 240, RES-ECON 212, SOCIOL 212, OR STATISTC 315/515, OR COMPSCI 240, with a grade of C or above. 4 credits.",

    "description": "This course will cover the design of personal health and wellness technologies. Using the personal health informatics model, we will learn various challenges in designing technologies for personal health data collection (e.g., step count, heart rate, or food intake etc.), integration, self-reflection, and behavior change. Going further, students will understand design issues in sharing personal health data and discuss design guidelines for collaborative data collection, reflection, and care. It is difficult to create health technologies that can successfully be integrated into people s daily life due to many obstacles in individuals data collection, integration, self-reflection, and sharing practices. Understanding these challenges is an important part of designing Health Technologies. Therefore, this course will cover HCI and design thinking methods that students can leverage to understand the adoption and use of Health Technologies and to design effective Health Technologies. Moreover, visualizations facilitate people to gain insights from their data, so we will cover common visualization approaches used in the personal data contexts. Students will apply the design issues taught during lecture to a team-based semester-long personal health application design project. This course satisfies the IE requirement for Informatics majors and it also counts as an elective for all concentrations of the Informatics major.
